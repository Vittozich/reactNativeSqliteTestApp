My ReactNative app. 
In this project contains components and pages templates, 
also contains work with sqllite database templates.

All examples in code, the sequence of actions can be tracked by commits!

I wanted to use React inside Ionic, 
but almost all components awful works with React and even doesn't work, 
also console commands doesn't work. Angular tool that is not worse than React.
